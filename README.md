This repository contains the code and the reports of the activities of the course "Numerical Laboratory of the Atmosphere and Ocean". Unfortunately, simulations output data is not available. All the reports are written in Italian.

**Atmosphere**:
1. [Numerical integration of Lorenz System](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean/blob/main/Lorenz_System.pdf) (**author: Federica Benassi**): the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations describes the chaotic behavior of particles in phase space, given a suitable set of parameters. Here, the solutions are obtained by an Euler forward integration method, and the chaoticity is quantified by evaluating the root mean square error between perturbed trajectories. Finally, the effect of a time-dependent forcing is shown.
2. [Numerical integration of barotropic vorticity equation](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean/blob/main/Charney_Forecast.pdf) (**authors: Federica Benassi, Beatrice Biagi, Serena Negroni, Deniel Pavone, Chiara Ventrucci**): the first successful weather prediction by Charney et al. is reproduced and the results of the forecast are compared with a persistency model and with the observations. The limits of the model and possible corrections are discussed. 
3. [Effects of El Niño on Walker Circulation](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean/blob/main/SPEEDY_Simulation.pdf) (**authors: Federica Benassi, Beatrice Biagi, Serena Negroni, Deniel Pavone, Chiara Ventrucci**): two outputs of SPEEDY model (one forced by El Niño, one without forcing) are compared and the effect of El Niño on Walker cell is assessed through the study of velocity potential field.

**Ocean**:
1. [Numerical integration of Shallow Water equations](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean/blob/main/Shallow_Water.pdf) (**author: Federica Benassi**): Shallow Water equations are a simplified version of Navier-Stokes equations that is suitable for the study of general ocean dynamics. Here, a one-dimensional and linearized version is integrated through different numerical methods and the results are compared. 
2. [Study of Florida Current through the implementation of a high-resolution nested model](https://github.com/fedebenassi/Numerical-Laboratory-of-the-Atmosphere-and-Ocean/blob/main/NEMO_Simulation.pdf) (**authors: Federica Benassi, Beatrice Biagi, Serena Negroni, Deniel Pavone, Chiara Ventrucci**): the dynamics of the Florida Current and the vertical thermal stratification is studied through the dynamical downscaling technique, implemented in the oceanic model NEMO.
